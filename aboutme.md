Hello, my name is Kelsey Franks. Thanks for checking out my website :D.

I can remember being on a computer before kindergarten. I always had a fascination with them. I did some electives with robotics and intro computer science classes during elementary and middle school. I was hooked. I knew I wanted to code for my career.  I started learning how to code in high school, starting with Java. Then, I went to college and mostly focused on C++. After I got my associate degree in Computer Science, I went to Arizona State University to get my bachelor's in Software Engineering. I learned more about Java, C/C#, SQL, and Python. I graduated in May 2024 and am now on the hunt for a job! 

When I'm not working on a coding project I like to read, embroider, 3-D print, and play video games. I usually do cross-stitch sometimes needlepoint. I also have recently gotten into faux-stained glass. My current art project is a Pusheen Holiday set that I got as a gift. My favorite video game is Stardew Valley. I am currently playing Marvel Rivals, Webfishing, and Baldur's Gate 3. I have mostly printed small projects and gifts. My goal is to start working on printing some organizing tools such as gridfinity. 

Thanks again for your intrest,

Kelsey Franks
