When looking for a job in the tech industry it is important to be able to prove your skills in a competitive market. Having a portfolio of educational work and personal projects is a good idea. I like many others thought why not kill two birds with one stone and create a website. Creating a website as my portfolio and demonstrating my skills at the same time. 

When looking into how to make a website most of the issue came around hosting. Luckily I stumbled upon Github Pages which does have limits but works out for making a portfolio. I did not have experience with HTML and CSS but took it as a learning opportunity.  I do have experience writing markdown documents and a bit of JS which did help in the implementation. I found a template, Beautiful Jekyll, which helped put down the foundation. With a couple of quick edits, I had a website with my name on it! Now to add information.  First I did a little about me page and then a page with my resume. I wanted my resume displayed and easily accessible so I looked into getting a pdf to work. Sure enough, there was an easy way to already do it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46105960/inserting-my-pdf-in-my-blogs. 

After getting the basic information down I wanted to add a little bit of style. So I got to work on adding a light and dark mode. While editing colors for the light mode I noticed that I was spending considerable time waiting for the web page to update with the edits. I remember in my class about running a website locally and how that might be easier to test rather than committing to Git Hub for every small edit. Especially when I was just changing the colors of text several times. Going back to the Git hub pages information page I found https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll. Which I followed the steps and easily got it to work. Now I am able to test faster.
