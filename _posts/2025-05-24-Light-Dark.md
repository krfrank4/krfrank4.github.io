# 🌗 Learning to Implement Dark/Light Mode in Web Design

As part of my interest in learning more about web design, I decided to explore how to implement a popular feature in modern websites: **dark/light mode**. This was a great way to deepen my understanding of CSS, JavaScript, and user experience.

## 🔍 Research and Inspiration

To begin, I looked at several personal portfolio websites that already had clean and functional implementations:

- [astrob0t.com](https://astrob0t.com/)
- [fdp.io](https://fdp.io/about/#)
- [aryamanmaithani.github.io](https://aryamanmaithani.github.io/)

I also explored some helpful resources and tutorials to understand how others built dark/light mode features:

- [Create a dark/light mode switch with CSS variables – DEV](https://dev.to/ananyaneogi/create-a-dark-light-mode-switch-with-css-variables-34l8)
- [StackOverflow: Dark/Light mode using two CSS files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61479387/dark-light-mode-using-two-css-files/70516556#70516556)
- [CodePen Demo by AllThingsSmitty](https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pen/MmxxOz/)
- [Light/Dark Mode in Jekyll – Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/22/4/light-dark-mode-jekyll)

## 🛠️ Steps I Took to Implement Dark/Light Mode

After doing some research, I broke the task into manageable steps and built the feature step by step:

1. **✨ Create a toggle button**  
   I added a toggle button that lets users switch between dark and light modes.

2. **🎨 Define CSS variables**  
   I created CSS variables to manage the main color scheme and defined different values for light and dark modes.

3. **💡 Add JavaScript functionality**  
   I wrote a small script that listens for the toggle button click and dynamically switches the theme by updating the CSS variables.

4. **📦 Save user preference**  
   To improve the user experience, I used `localStorage` to save the user’s theme preference so it persists across page reloads and visits.

5. **🧪 Test and customize**  
   I customized the appearance of both themes to match my site’s branding and adjusted the toggle button's style to blend with the overall design. Edit it so that it looks good in desktop and mobile views.

This small project helped me understand how front-end technologies work together to enhance user experience. I’m excited to keep building on this and exploring more ways to make websites interactive and user-friendly.
