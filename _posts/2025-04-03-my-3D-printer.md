I have an Ender 3 3D printer. It takes melted plastic and prints it layer by layer to create an object. To learn more about 3D printers [here](https://ultimaker.com/learn/what-is-3d-printing/) is a link with more information.

I have done some modifications and upgrades to it as time has gone by. I first added a CR touch that probes the print bed to measure its flatness. When printing, it is important that the print bed is as flat and level as possible. I also upgraded the control board to Creality's V4.2.7, which had a port for the CR touch and quieter stepper drivers. This greatly reduced the noise. I upgraded the Bowden tube, which carries the plastic to where it will get melted, to one with a higher melting point.

I had to replace a couple of broken parts on it after a while. The plastic extruder feeder drive arm broke. I replaced it with an aluminum one. The belt tensions weren't working after a while and were difficult to calibrate so I upgraded them. I could have printed both parts but since I needed them to print I had to buy them instead. If I had another printer I could have printed the spare parts. One of the blades on the hot-end fan broke so I also replaced the fan.

Creatiliy makers of Ender 3 only tin the wires to the control board. Over time the wires get loose after compression. The electricity can creep and heat up the screw terminal which can cause a fire. I put ferrules on all the wires that protect them and replaced the control board with BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 V3.0. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F4zQVzDRww) explains the problem very well as well as how to ferrule the wires. I also got an enclosure to be a little more fire-safe and to keep a more consistent temperature.
